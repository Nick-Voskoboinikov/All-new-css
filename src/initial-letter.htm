        <p>Modern web development also includes web applications. Web applications are software packages that run on a
            web
            server and are accessed through the internet. This is unlike a traditional application that runs on your
            computer, tablet, or phone.</p>

        <p>Front-end web development has to do with the interface that you, the user, interact with when you visit a
            website
            or use a web application. Front-End Developers create everything you see on a web page.</p>

        <p>Back-end web development has to do with the parts of a website that you canâ€™t see, particularly how website
            information is stored and retrieved.</p>
